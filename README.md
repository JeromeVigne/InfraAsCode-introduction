 # Azure infrastructure as Code - introduction

 This repo aims at giving you all you need to get started developing infrastructure as code with ARM templates in minutes. I have been helping customers build CICD pipelines with INfrastructure as code for the past 2 years and am trying to share all the best practices I have developped for myself here.

 This repo contains multiple chapters that get more and more advanced:
 - 01_Getting_Started will guide you through the tooling needed and help deploy the first ARM template
 - 02_tbd will something something
