 # Azure infrastructure as Code - introduction

 This repo aims at giving you all you need to get started developing infrastructure as code with ARM templates in minutes. I have been helping customers build CICD pipelines with Infrastructure as code for the past 2 years and am trying to share all the best practices I have developped for myself here.

 It is built in different modules that will lead you from your very first resource created as *Infrastructure as Code* to having a production grade *multi-stage CICD pipeline with secret stores and variables*

 This repo contains multiple chapters that get more and more advanced:
 - 01 An introduction to ARM
 - 02 Here we will set up all the tools we need for our first deployment
 - 03_work_in_progress (will be cool functions and tipps)
 - 04 Here we will build a build and release pipeline in DevOps.
