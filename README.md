 # Azure infrastructure as Code - welcome

 This repo aims to give you all you need to get started developing infrastructure as code with ARM templates in minutes. I have been helping customers build CICD pipelines with infrastructure as code for the past two years, and will share all the best practices I have developed for myself here.

 Our repo is built in different modules that will lead you from your very first resource created as *Infrastructure as Code* to having a production grade *multi-stage CICD pipeline with secret stores and variables*

 It contains multiple chapters that get more and more advanced:
 - 01 An introduction to ARM
 - 02 Here we will set up all the tools we need for our first deployment
 - 03 Here we will create a build and release pipeline in DevOps.
 - 04 more to come!
